# TODO List - GuessRush Project Improvements

## ‚úÖ Recently Completed
- Personal stats UI overhaul (tabs, cards, icons, larger fonts, player rank improvements)
- Stats logic: robust null/default handling, correct best time/score logic
- Input validation for out-of-range guesses
- Stat cards: brighter background for readability
- Remove all debug logs
- Double Chaos: Game Over is now shown only when attempts run out, not on timer or invalid input.
- Invalid input (out of range) no longer ends the game, only shows an error message.
- guessHistory is now managed as part of the global state, not as a global variable.
- All debug console logs have been removed.
- End-of-game summary is shown only for real win/loss, not for invalid input.
